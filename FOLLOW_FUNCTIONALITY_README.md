# Follow Functionality Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the follow functionality in ReptiGram, which allows users to follow other users and prioritize their posts in the feed.

## Features

### 1. Follow/Unfollow Users
- Users can follow other users by clicking the "Follow" button on their posts
- The button changes to "Following" when a user is already being followed
- Users cannot follow themselves
- Follow status is stored in Firestore

### 2. Post Prioritization
- Posts from followed users are displayed at the top of the feed
- Within each group (followed/unfollowed), posts are sorted by timestamp (newest first)
- The feed automatically reorders when follow status changes

### 3. Visual Indicators
- A green "Following" badge appears next to usernames of followed users
- Follow buttons show different colors and text based on follow status
- A summary section shows how many users the current user is following

## Technical Implementation

### Database Structure

#### Followers Collection
```
followers/{followerId-followedUserId}
├── followerId: string (UID of the user doing the following)
├── followedUserId: string (UID of the user being followed)
└── timestamp: timestamp (when the follow relationship was created)
```

### Models Updated

#### PostModel
- Added `isFollowing` boolean field to track follow status
- Used for sorting and UI display

### Services Updated

#### FirestoreService
- `followUser(followerId, followedUserId)`: Creates follow relationship
- `unfollowUser(followerId, followedUserId)`: Removes follow relationship
- `isFollowingUser(followerId, followedUserId)`: Checks follow status
- `getFollowedUserIds(userId)`: Gets list of users being followed
- `getFollowerUserIds(userId)`: Gets list of users following the given user
- `getPostsWithFollowPriority(userId)`: Gets posts with follow priority

### UI Components

#### Follow Button
- Positioned on the right side of each post header
- Only visible for posts from other users
- Changes appearance based on follow status:
  - **Follow**: Brown background with "Follow" text
  - **Following**: Grey background with "Following" text

#### Follow Indicator Badge
- Green badge with "Following" text
- Appears next to usernames of followed users
- Small, rounded design with green color scheme

#### Follow Summary Section
- Shows at the top of the posts feed
- Displays count of users being followed
- Includes informational text about post prioritization
- Styled with brown gradient background

## Security Rules

### Firestore Rules
```javascript
// Followers collection: allow authenticated users to follow/unfollow
match /followers/{followId} {
  allow read: if request.auth != null;
  allow create, update, delete: if request.auth != null 
    && request.auth.uid == resource.data.followerId;
  
  // For create operations, validate the followerId matches the authenticated user
  allow create: if request.auth != null 
    && request.resource.data.followerId == request.auth.uid;
}
```

## Usage Flow

1. **Viewing Posts**: Users see posts from all users, with followed users' posts prioritized
2. **Following a User**: Click "Follow" button on any post from another user
3. **Following Status**: Button changes to "Following" and post moves to top of feed
4. **Unfollowing**: Click "Following" button to unfollow and remove prioritization
5. **Feed Updates**: Feed automatically reorders when follow status changes

## Performance Considerations

- Follow status is fetched in batch for all posts
- Posts are sorted client-side after data retrieval
- Follow relationships use compound document IDs for efficient queries
- Fallback to regular post loading if follow priority fails

## Testing

A test script (`test_follow_functionality.js`) is provided to verify:
- Follow/unfollow operations
- Follow status verification
- Database operations
- Cleanup procedures

## Future Enhancements

- Follow suggestions based on user activity
- Follow notifications
- Follow counts and statistics
- Follow lists and profiles
- Follow privacy settings

## Files Modified

- `lib/models/post_model.dart` - Added follow status field
- `lib/services/firestore_service.dart` - Added follow operations
- `lib/screens/post_screen.dart` - Added follow UI and logic
- `firestore_rules.rules` - Added followers collection rules
- `test_follow_functionality.js` - Test script for verification

## Deployment Notes

1. Deploy updated Firestore rules: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`
2. The followers collection will be created automatically when first used
3. Existing posts will show as unfollowed until users manually follow authors
4. No data migration required for existing functionality
