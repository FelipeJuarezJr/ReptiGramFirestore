# Desktop Notification Fix Guide

## Issue Summary
- ✅ Mobile PWA notifications work (gecko1@gmail.com receives notifications)
- ❌ Desktop web notifications don't work (mr.felipe.juarez.jr@gmail.com receives no notifications)

## Root Cause Analysis
The desktop user is not receiving notifications because:
1. **Notification permissions not granted** - Web browsers require explicit permission
2. **Service worker not registered** - Required for background notifications
3. **FCM token not generated** - No token means no notifications can be sent
4. **Browser notification settings** - User may have blocked notifications

## Fixes Applied ✅

### 1. Enhanced HTML Notification Setup
- **File**: `web/index.html`
- **Added**: Explicit notification permission request
- **Added**: Service worker registration
- **Added**: FCM token generation in HTML
- **Added**: Better error handling and logging

### 2. Improved Flutter Web Handling
- **File**: `lib/main.dart`
- **Added**: Web-specific FCM token handling
- **Added**: Fallback token generation
- **Added**: Better permission handling for web

### 3. Updated Service Worker
- **File**: `web/firebase-messaging-sw.js`
- **Fixed**: Firebase SDK version mismatch
- **Added**: Better notification options
